Title: Cool System Access Login demonstration without using Command Button (just Textbox)

Description: Inspired from hacker, spy and computer related movies, I create this program to simulate those movies. A program which have a futuristic interface.
It will accepted or denied input of your password that you've typed by pressing enter only. No command button needed, just one textbox.
Next version I'll update it to be have more futuristic interface (such as: semitransparent effect and cutting edge effect) and more proffesional coding.
Try it! Please put your comment and vote for me.
